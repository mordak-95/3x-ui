As an enhanced fork of the original X-UI project, 3X-UI provides improved stability, broader protocol support, and additional features.

## PostgreSQL Support

This version of 3X-UI includes PostgreSQL database support, allowing you to connect to an external PostgreSQL database server. This enables you to:

- Store your 3X-UI data on a separate database server
- Use a managed PostgreSQL service (like AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, etc.)
- Implement database clustering and high availability
- Separate your application and data layers

For detailed setup instructions, please refer to the [PostgreSQL Setup Guide](POSTGRESQL_SETUP.md).

## Quick Start

```bash
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mordak-95/3x-ui/master/install.sh)
